## 2024-05-22 - Terminal Navigation Patterns
**Learning:** Terminal apps often trap users in deep states without a "back" button, unlike web/mobile apps where the back button is omnipresent. Explicit "Esc" or "Back" navigation is critical.
**Action:** Always verify that every screen has a way to return to the previous screen without killing the app.
