# Specification: General Backlog

## Purpose
The Backlog track acts as a catch-all for tasks, bugs, and explorations that do not currently belong to a major project track. It ensures that every piece of work in the Linear `TVELO` team has a corresponding entry in the repository.

## Workflow
- **Creation:** New issues created in Linear without a project are automatically synced to this track's `plan.md`.
- **Promotion:** When a collection of tasks or a single large task warrants a dedicated project, they are moved from this track to a new project track.
- **Resolution:** Small bugs and chores are completed directly within this track.
