# Product Guidelines - Terminal Velocity

## Tone & Voice
The tone of Terminal Velocity is **Casual & Friendly**. While the project addresses complex architectural patterns, the communication should be approachable and encouraging. 
- Avoid overly dense technical jargon where simple terms suffice.
- Use friendly prompts and encouraging feedback during gameplay.
- Aim to make the learning experience feel like a collaborative discovery rather than a formal lecture.

## Visual Identity & UI Design
The visual design prioritizes a **Clean & Minimalist** aesthetic. 
- **Legibility First:** Use standard terminal fonts and avoid cluttering the screen with unnecessary decorative elements.
- **Whitespace:** Employ generous padding and spacing to separate different UI sections, making the structure of the Mosaic components easier to discern.
- **Purposeful Color:** Use ANSI colors sparingly to highlight interactive elements (like the current word to type) or status changes (correct/incorrect input).

## Educational Strategy
Terminal Velocity employs an **Implicit Learning** approach.
- **Intuitive UI:** The interface should be so clear that the underlying Circuit state management feels like a natural extension of the user's actions.
- **Code as Documentation:** Since the audience is developers, the code itself is the primary educational resource. The UI should directly reflect the structure and state transitions defined in the Kotlin code.
- **Focus on Flow:** By minimizing explicit in-app explanations, the user remains immersed in the gameplay, allowing them to focus on the *feel* of a well-architected UDF application.
