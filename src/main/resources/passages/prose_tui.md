Terminal user interfaces are a text-based user interface used to interact with a computer program. They were the dominant method of user interaction with computers during the early era of computing. Today, they are still widely used by system administrators and advanced users. Tools like Mosaic allow developers to build modern TUIs using declarative UI patterns. This brings the power of Jetpack Compose to the command line, enabling reactive UIs. With TUIs, you can create efficient and fast interfaces that run in any terminal emulator. They are particularly useful for remote server management and automation tasks.
