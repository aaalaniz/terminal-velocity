Functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values. Functional programming avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style. Key concepts include pure functions, higher-order functions, and immutability. Languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang are primarily functional. Modern languages like Kotlin and Swift also support functional programming features.
