Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its primary development is from a team of JetBrains programmers based in Saint Petersburg, Russia. While the syntax is not compatible with Java, Kotlin is designed to interoperate with Java code. It uses aggressive type inference to determine the type of values and expressions for which type has been left unstated. This makes the code more concise and easier to read compared to some other languages. Kotlin has support for functional programming, including higher-order functions and lambdas.
