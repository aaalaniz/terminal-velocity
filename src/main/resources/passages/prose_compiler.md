A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language into another language. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language. This lower level language is typically assembly language, object code, or machine code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program. Compilers perform many operations, including lexical analysis, preprocessing, parsing, and semantic analysis. They also perform code generation and code optimization. A compiler is distinct from an interpreter, which executes the program directly.
