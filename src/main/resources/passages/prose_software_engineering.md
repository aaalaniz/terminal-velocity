Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software. It involves the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software. Software engineers apply the principles of engineering to the software development process. The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. Common models include the Waterfall model, Agile model, and Spiral model. Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. Testing ensures that the software meets the requirements and is free of bugs.
