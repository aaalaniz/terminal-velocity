The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It also runs programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required of a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations. Key features include memory management via garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. The JVM allows Java programs to follow the write once, run anywhere principle. It provides a platform-independent execution environment that converts bytecode into machine code.
