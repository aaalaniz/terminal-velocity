Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. There are many different types of data structures, each suited to different kinds of applications. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees. Hash tables are used for fast data retrieval based on keys. Graphs are used to represent networks and relationships between objects. Choosing the right data structure is crucial for writing efficient algorithms.
