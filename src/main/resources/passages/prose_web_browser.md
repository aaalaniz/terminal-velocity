A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server. It then displays the page on the user's device. Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages. The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Modern browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. They support features like tabs, bookmarks, and extensions.
