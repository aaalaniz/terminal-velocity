Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information. They can also be used to extort money from users or interrupt normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people. Attackers are becoming more innovative. Key elements include network security, application security, and information security. Regular updates and patches are crucial for maintaining security.
